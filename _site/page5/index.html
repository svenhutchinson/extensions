        A New Way to Handle Synonyms in a Search Engine
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 May 2014</span>

    <p>We recently added the support for Synonyms in Algolia! It has been the most
requested feature in Algolia since our launch in September. While it may seem
simple, it actually took us some time to implement because we wanted to do it
in a different way than classic search engines.</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-synonyms">What’s wrong with synonyms</h2>

<p>There are two main problems with how existing search engines handle synonyms.
These issues disturb the user experience and could make them think <em>“this
search engine is buggy”</em>.</p>

<h3 id="typeahead">Typeahead</h3>

<p>In most search engines, synonyms are not compatible with typeahead search. For
example, if you want tablet  to equal  ipad in a query, the prefix search for
t , ta , tab , tabl  &amp; table  will not trigger the expansion on iPad ; Only
the tablet query will. Thus, a single new letter in the search bar could
totally change the result set, catching users off-guard.</p>

<h3 id="highlighting">Highlighting</h3>

<p>Highlighting matched text is a key element of the user experience, especially
when the search engine tolerates typos. This is the difference between making
users think <em>“I don’t understand this result”</em> and <em>“This engine was able to
understand my errors”</em>. Synonym expansions are rarely highlighted, which
breaks the trust of the users in the search results and can feel like a bug.</p>

<h2 id="our-implementation">Our implementation</h2>

<p>We have identified two different use cases for synonyms: equalities and
placeholders. The first and most common use case is when you tell the search
engine that several words must be considered equal, for example st and street
in an address. The second use case, which we call a <em>placeholder</em>, is when you
indicate that a specific token can be replaced by a set of possible words and
that the token itself is not searchable. For example, the content <number>
street could be matched by the queries 1st street or 2nd street but not the
query number street.</number></p>

<p>For the first use case, we have added a support of synonyms that is compatible
with prefix search and have implemented two different ways to do highlighting
(controlled by thereplaceSynonymsInHighlight  query parameter):</p>

<ol>
  <li>A mode where the original word that matched via a synonym is highlighted. For example if you have a record that contains black ipad 64GB  and a synonym black equals dark, then the following queries will fully highlight the black word : ipad d , ipad da , ipad dar &amp; ipad dark. The typeahead search is working and the synonym expansion is fully highlighted: <code>**black** **ipad** 64GB</code> .</li>
  <li>A mode where the original word is replaced by the synonym, and the matched prefix is highlighted. For example ipad d  query will replace black by dark and will highlight the first letter of dark: <code>**d**ark **ipad** 64GB</code>. This method allows to fully explain the results when the original word can be safely replaced by the matched synonym.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the second use case, we have added support for placeholders. You can add a
specific token in your records that will be safely replaced by a set of words
defined in your configuration. The highlighting mode that replaces the
original word by the expansion totally makes sense here. For example if you
have <streetnumber> mission street  record with a placeholder <streetnumber> =
[ "1st", "2nd", ....] , then the query 1st missionstreet will replace <number>
by 1st  and will highlight all words: `**1st mission street**`.</number></streetnumber></streetnumber></p>

<p>We believe this is a better way to handle synonyms and we hope you will like
it :) We would love to get your feedback and ideas for improvement on this
feature! Feel free to contact us at <strong>hey(at)algolia.com</strong>.</p>

      <a href="/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/2014/05/14/jsonp-still-mandatory/">
        Why JSONP is still Mandatory
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>

    <p>At Algolia, we are convinced that search queries need to be sent directly from
the browser (or mobile app) to the search-engine in order to have a realtime
search experience. This is why we have developed a search backend that replies
within a few milliseconds through an API that <a href="http://blog.algolia.com/handle-security-realtime-search/">handles
security</a> when
called from the browser.</p>

<h2 id="cross-domain-requests">Cross domain requests</h2>

<p>For security reasons, the default behavior of a web browser is to block all
queries that are going to a domain that is different from the website they are
sent from. So when using an external HTTP-based search API, all your queries
should be blocked because they are sent to an external domain. There are two
methods to call an external API from the browser:</p>

<h3 id="jsonp"> JSONP</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> approach is a workaround that
consists of calling an external API  with a DOM <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>  tag. The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
tag is allowed to load content from any domains without security restrictions.
The targeted API needs to expose a HTTP GET endpoint and return Javascript
code instead of the regular JSON data. You can use this jQuery code to
dynamically call a JSONP URL:</p>

<p><code>javascript
$.getJSON( "http://api.algolia.io/1/indexes/users?query=test", function( data ) { .... }
</code></p>

<p>In order to retrieve the API answer from the newly included JavaScript code,
jQuery automatically appends a callback argument to your URL (for example
&amp;callback=method12 ) which must be called by the JavaScript code that your API
generates.</p>

<p>This is what a regular JSON reply would look like:</p>

<p><code>json
{
  "results": [ ...]
}
</code></p>

<p>Instead, the JSONP-compliant API generates:</p>

<p><code>javascript
method12({"results": [ ...]});
</code></p>

<h3 id="cross-origin-resource-sharing">Cross Origin Resource Sharing</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> (Cross
Origin Resource Sharing) is the proper approach to perform a call to an
external domain. If the remote API is CORS-compliant, you can use a regular
XMLHttpRequest  JavaScript object to perform the API call. In practice the
browser will first perform an HTTP OPTIONS request to the remote API to check
which caller domains are allowed and if it is authorized to execute the
requested URL.</p>

<p>For example here is a CORS request issued by a browser. The most important
lines are the last two headers that specify which permissions are checked. In
this case, the method is POST and the three specific HTTP headers that are
requested.</p>

<pre><code>OPTIONS http://latency.algolia.io/1/indexes/*/queries
&gt; Host: latency.algolia.io
&gt; Origin: http://demos.algolia.com
&gt; Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
&gt; Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6
&gt; User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_2)
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt; Referer: http://demos.algolia.com/eventbrite/
&gt; Connection: keep-alive
&gt; Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-algolia-api-key, x-algolia-application-id, content-type
&gt; Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
</code></pre>

<p>The server reply will be similar to this one:</p>

<pre><code>&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Server: nginx/1.6.0
&lt; Date: Tue, 13 May 2014 08:33:55 GMT
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain
&lt; Content-Length: 0
&lt; Connection: keep-alive
&lt; Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
&lt; Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, OPTIONS
&lt; Access-Control-Allow-Headers: x-algolia-api-key, x-algolia-application-id, content-type
&lt; Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false &lt; Expires: Wed, 14 May 2014 08:33:55 GMT
&lt; Cache-Control: max-age=86400
&lt; Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
</code></pre>

<p>This answer indicates that this POST method can be called from any domain
(Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * ) and with the requested headers.</p>

<p>CORS has many advantages. First, it allows access to a real REST API with all
HTTP verbs (mainly GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and it also allows to better handle
errors in an API (bad requests, object not found, …). The major drawback is
that it is only supported by modern browsers (Internet Explorer ≥ 10, Firefox
≥ 3.5, Chrome ≥ 3, Safari ≥ 4 &amp; Opera ≥ 12; Internet Explorer 8 &amp; 9 provides
partial support via theXDomainRequest  object).</p>

<h2 id="our-initial-conclusion">Our initial conclusion</h2>

<p>Because of the advantages of CORS in terms of error handling, we started with
a CORS implementation of our API. We also added a specific support for
Internet Explorer 8 &amp; 9 using the  XDomainRequest  JavaScript object (they do
not support XMLHttpRequest). The main difference is that XDomainRequest  does
not support HTTP headers so we added another way to specify user credentials
in the body of the POST request (it was initially only supported via HTTP
headers).</p>

<p>We were confident that we were supporting almost all browsers with this
implementation, as only very old browsers could cause problems. But we were
wrong!</p>

<h2 id="cors-problems">CORS problems</h2>

<p>The reality is that CORS still causes problems, even with modern browsers. The
biggest problem we have found was with some firewalls/proxies that refuse HTTP
OPTIONS queries. We even found software on some computers that were blocking
CORS requests, as the <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2559-cisco-anyconnect-vpn-client-may-
block-cors-ajax-options-requests.htm">Cisco AnyConnect VPN
client</a>, which is widely used in the enterprise
world. We have found this issue when a TechCrunch employee was not able to
operate search on <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com">crunchbase.com</a> because the
AnyConnect VPN client was installed on his laptop.</p>

<p>Even in 2014 with a large majority of browsers supporting CORS, it is not
possible to have perfect service quality with a CORS-enabled REST API!</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>Using JSONP is the only solution to ensure great compatibility with old
browsers and handle problems with a misconfigured firewall/proxy. However,
CORS offers the advantage of proper error-handling, so we do not want to limit
ourselves to JSONP.</p>

<p>In the latest version of our JavaScript client, we decided to use CORS with a
fallback on JSONP. At client initialization time, we check if the browser
supports CORS and then perform an OPTIONS query to check that there is no
firewall/proxy that blocks CORS requests. If there is any error we fallback on
JSONP. All this logic is available in our JavaScript client without any
API/code change for our customers.</p>

<p>Having CORS support with automatic fallback on JSONP is the best way we have
found to ensure great service quality and to support all corner case
scenarios. If you see any other way to do it, your feedback is very welcome.</p>

    <p>We interviewed <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanLaCom">Dylan La Com</a>, Growth Product
Manager at <a href="https://qualaroo.com">Qualaroo</a> &amp;
<a href="http://growthhackers.com">GrowthHackers.com</a>, about their Algolia
implementation experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.algolia.com/wp-
content/uploads/2014/05/growthacker.jpg"><img src="/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/assets/growthacker.jpg" alt="growthacker" /></a></p>

<h3 id="what-role-did-search-play-at-growthhackers-before-the-algolia">What role did search play at GrowthHackers before the Algolia</h3>
<p>implementation?</p>

<p>When we launched our community site
<a href="http://growthhackers.com/">GrowthHackers.com</a> in October 2013, search was
admittedly an afterthought for us. GrowthHackers is a social-voting site where
marketers, founders, and product-people can share and discuss growth-related
content. At launch, it was unclear what role search would have on the site.
GrowthHackers is built on Wordpress, and with that comes Wordpress’ standard
search functionality. What WP search does is append an additional keyword or
phrase parameter to its typical post query and load a new page with the
results. WP search only indexed the outbound URLs of the articles our members
submitted, and this made finding specific content difficult.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-want-to-give-search-an-update-on-growthhackers">Why did you want to give search an update on GrowthHackers?</h3>

<p>We started hearing about our lack of a solid search feature from some of our
more active users. One of our members even put together a slide presentation
to prove just how useless our search was [<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/andrewmatthewthompson/improving-search-on-growthhackers">check it out
here</a>]. At the same time, GrowthHackers was becoming more than just a
way to stay up-to-date on the best growth articles, it was becoming the place
to get answers: an encyclopedia for growth-related information. Search volume
at this time was peaking in the mid-hundreds per week. We needed a search
feature that could support this evolving use-case.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-choose-algolia">Why did you choose Algolia?</h3>

<p>We looked at several search solutions before trying Algolia, including
Swiftype, WP Search (plugin), and Srch2. All are great solutions, but
ultimately, we went with Algolia because they had the right mix of features:
Their integration was simple, the documentation was thorough, and there were
plenty of starter templates. I knew it was a good sign when, while looking
their GitHub repository, I found they had a demo site built with search that
worked very similar to how we hoped ours would work, complete with real-time
results, typo-tolerance, and filters. The Algolia team was incredibly helpful
getting us set up and was there each step of the way through the integration
process, providing resources and best practices for creating a truly top-notch
search experience.</p>

<h3 id="tell-me-a-little-about-how-the-new-search-works">Tell me a little about how the new search works.</h3>

<p>Our primary use of Algolia is to store and index user submitted content, and
provide real-time search in our growing database of growth-related articles,
questions, videos and slides. The majority of what we index is article titles
and URLs–strings which are generally small. Visitors to our site often come
with specific growth-related questions and use our search to find answers
quickly. For example, someone interested in learning best practices for
running Twitter ads could type in “Twitter ad” and within milliseconds see
dozens of articles and discussions related to maximizing ROI for Twitter ads.
Using Algolia’s admin dashboard, we’re able to set ranking priorities based on
the number of votes and comments of each article, and make sure the top
results are the most relevant. So, the visitor who searches “Twitter ad” is
shown articles with the highest mix of votes and comments. Algolia took the
search ranking process and wrapped it in a clean and simple interface that
allows anyone, regardless of their experience with search, to easily adjust
and manipulate.</p>

<p>One of the challenges we faced during the integration process was
understanding how to keep our main database synced and up to date with our
Algolia index. User submitted content on GrowthHackers changes often as users
interact with the content. Each post once submitted may receive upvotes and
comments from members in the community. Each post also has a wiki-style
summary field that can be edited by community members. Lastly, posts can have
several states, including published, pending and trashed. In order to ensure
our content on Algolia mirrored the content in our database, we set up a job
queue and a cron process to periodically push updates to our Algolia index.
This has been working quite well for us.</p>

<h3 id="how-has-the-new-search-impacted-engagement">How has the new search impacted engagement?</h3>

<p>We released the new search mid-February, and since the release we’ve seen
search volume increase 4-5X. Of course there are several factors at play here,
including increased traffic volume and better search bar placement, but it is
clear that Algolia’s search features have contributed to an impressive
increase in search engagement. On average, visitors who utilize search view
2-3X more pages per session and spend 5-6X longer on the site than those who
don’t search. Algolia’s analytics dashboard provides us with an incredible
glimpse of visitor intent on our site by showing us the queries visitors are
searching for, and trend lines to show popularity over time. With this data,
we’re able to better understand how our visitors want to use our site, and
make better decisions about how to organize the content.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we’re hoping to implement Algolia’s search filters to provide
even better ways to access content on our site. We’re excited to have such a
powerful tool in our stack and hope to experiment with new ways to provide
search functionality throughout GrowthHackers.</p>

        Dealing with OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Yesterday, the OpenSSL project released an update to fix a serious security
issue. This vulnerability was disclosed in <a href="https://web.nvd.nis
t.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a> and is more widely known as the
<a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. It allows an attacker to
grab the content in memory on a server. Given the widespread use of OpenSSL
and the versions affected, this vulnerability affects a large percentage of
services on the internet.</p>

<p>Once the exploit was revealed, we responded immediately: All Algolia services
were secured the same day, by 3pm PDT on Monday, April 7th. The fix was
applied on all our API servers and our website. We then generated new SSL
certificates with a new private key.</p>

<p>Our website is also dependent on Amazon Elastic Load Balance, which was
affected by this issue and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security/security-
bulletins/aws-services-updated-to-address-openssl-vulnerability/">updated</a> later on
Tuesday, April 8th. We then changed the website certificate.</p>

<p><strong>All Algolia servers are no longer exposed to this vulnerability.</strong></p>

<h2 id="your-credentials">Your credentials</h2>

<p>We took the time to analyze the past activity on our servers and did not find
any suspicious activity. We are confident that no credentials were leaked.
However, given that this exploit existed in the wild for such a long time, it
is possible that an attacker could have stolen API keys or passwords without
our knowledge. As a result, we recommend that all Algolia users change the
passwords on their accounts. We also recommend that you reset your Algolia
administration API key, which you can do at the bottom of the “Credential”
section in your dashboard. Be careful to update it everywhere you use it in
your code (once you have patched your SSL library if you too are vulnerable).</p>

<h2 id="security-at-algolia">Security at Algolia</h2>

<p>The safety and security of our customer data are our highest priorities. We
are continuing to monitor the situation and will respond rapidly to any other
potential threats that may be discovered.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please email us directly at
<a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#115;&#101;&#099;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#064;&#097;&#108;&#103;&#111;&#108;&#105;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#115;&#101;&#099;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#064;&#097;&#108;&#103;&#111;&#108;&#105;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a></p>

        Introducing Search Analytics: Know Your Users Better
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>This week we have released a much requested feature by our customers:
analytics.</p>

<h3 id="the-importance-of-analytics-to-search">The importance of analytics to search</h3>

<p>At Algolia, our goal is to revolutionize the way people search and access
content inside the Web and mobile services. Think about Spotify, LinkedIn,
Amazon: Everyone wants to find the right songs, people and products in just a
couple keystrokes. Our challenge is to provide fast and meaningful access to
all of this content via a simple search box. In March, we answered more than
200 million user queries for our customers on every continent.</p>

<p>Providing the right content through the right search and browsing experience
is key. For our customers, understanding their users - what they like, what
they want and when they want it -  is just as important, if not more. This is
why we came up with this new analytics section, built on top of our API and
available on our customers’ online dashboards when they log in to their
Algolia account. So what exactly do we track for you?</p>

<p>We describe here some of the top features that are now available to all our
users.</p>

<h3 id="most-popular-queries">Most popular queries</h3>

<p>In this chart, we show which items were most queried. It would be useful, for
example, to a procurement department for anticipating their  most frequently-
searched products’ inventory needs. And if you monetize your service through
advertising, know what people are most interested in is especially valuable.</p>

<p>A new analytics feature supports the most popular queries.</p>

<h3 id="queries-with-no-or-a-few-results">Queries with no or a few results</h3>

<p>Today, most services are simply clueless when it comes to what is missing in
their content base. How do you know that your catalogue of products fits your
users’ expectations? Knowing whether or not you provide what your users need
is critical for your business.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.algolia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Top-search.png"><img src="/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/assets/Top-search-1024x409.png" alt="Search Analytics: Track top queries" /></a> Algolia lets you determine which top queries have few or
nonexistent results.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-a-query-evolve-over-time">How does a query evolve over time?</h3>

<p>Is Chanel more popular than Louis Vuitton in the morning or at night? Are
bikes more popular in June or in December? With this new feature, you can now
answer such questions for your own content by following the number of times a
specific query is typed on an hourly basis.</p>

<p><img src="/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/assets/Trend Louboutin.png" alt="Search Analytics: Track
popularity of a search query over
time" /> Example: Search
analytics lets you track the evolution of the query “louboutin” over 24
hours.</p>

<h3 id="which-categories-do-people-search-the-most">Which categories do people search the most?</h3>

<p>When users type in a query, they often use categories to refine the results.
We let you know which categories were the most frequently used for refinement.
We even provide the most used combinations of categories (such as “dress” +
“blue” + “size M”). It should help you understand how your users browse your
content and has broader implications if the ergonomics of your app is
optimized.</p>

combinations of categories people search for the most.</p>

<p>These new analytics features are included in our existing plans at no extra
cost. The number of days when our analytics tools are available vary based on
the plan you choose. We hope you will like it, and we will be more than happy
to read your feedback and feature requests!</p>
